# excubia
Hack the North 2017

## Inspiration
CANSOFCOM members are required to watch surveillance videos for extended period of time. Our program automates the process, freeing personnel of countless hours of manual observance.

## What it does
Detect faces in realtime video stream through a webserver Recognize facial landmarks for each face on screen
Count number of faces present in realtime and detect abnormality

## Challenges we ran into
Installing dependencies to be compatible with other systems
Training machine to recognize and remember seen faces

## What's next for excubia
Machine learning - train to identify, track individuals' occurrences and detect abnormality
Detect criminals and terrorists
Not only track faces, but also body movements

## Built with
python, opencv, dlib and mongoDB
